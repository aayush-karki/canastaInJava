# Canasta In Java

## Oct 25, 2022:

-   Downloaded Android Studio and read documentation for it ( 2 hours ).

###### Total: 2 hours

## Oct 28, 2022:

-   Started on the java translation, set up the java enviornment by downloading sdk and other tools for java development for vs code ( 2 hours ).

-   Tried to run hello world program on java in vs code, but it would not run on vs code ( 1 hour ).

-   Scraped my project and then stated to follow online guide from vs code official website. The problem still presisted so searched differnet sites for a solution. The solution after experimenting was to use run jave instead of run code ( 2 hour ).

###### Total: 5 hours

## Nov 01, 2022:

-   Started to create ValidRankSuit Class. copied the code form .h file and got stuck on error where it would say to close } when the ctor was empty. Could not figure out where the problem was and tried to see if java would support empty contructor. Debugged the code; it turns out that the problem was due to copying c++ code where java compiler would not like funciotn declaration that were below the line that was curretnly getting edited ( 2 hours ).

-   Completed the validRankSuit class, by swapping the c++ code for java code ( 1 hour ).

-   Created a test program for the class by using its main method ( 30 minutes ).

-   Researched and moved a tests from the main method to the test class and extended the tests( 1 hour and 30 minutes ).

###### Total: 5 hours.

## Nov 06, 2022:

-   to get a better grasp and be more familar with java programing, made a small
    snake game using java ( 2 hours ).

-   Started and completed to create card Class ( 2 hours ).

###### Total: 4 hours.

## Nov 08, 2022:

-   started on hand class ( 30 minutes ).

-   Messed up the git repo and fixed it ( 1 hour and 30 minutes ).

-   researched alternative to std::pair. insted of using javafx module's pair class, decided to make my own simple pair class ( 1 hour and 30 minutes ).

-   To sort the hand, researched alternative to operator overload. Ended chaninging the card class to implement Comparable interface and created unit test for it ( 1 hour ).

###### Total: 4 hours and 30 minutes.

## Nov 10, 2022:

-   Added mutators to Pair Class and created and populated the PairTest Class ( 1 hour ).

-   Changed the ValidRankSuit class to use String instead of char ( 30 minutes )

-   refactored the ValidRankSuitTest class to match the changes and swapped the asserts parameter( 1 hour ).

-   Similarly Changed the Card class to use String instead of char ( 30 minutes ).

-   Redid the compareTo funciton and researched and override the equals funciton ( 1 hour ).

###### Total: 4 hours.

## Nov 11, 2022:

-   Redid the testCardClass ( 2 hours ).

-   Added the toString method to the card Class ( 15 minutes ).

-   Continued working on the hand class. In the process of transating the constructor for the calss, made the function that it depended on like sortMeld(), addCardToHand(), addRed3ToMeld) ( 2 hours ).

###### Total: 4 hours.

## Nov 12, 2022:

-   Continued working on the hand class. Made addCardToMeld() funcnction ( 30 minutes ).

-   tested all the funcitons that were currently in the hand Class ( 2 hour ).

-   Made and tested the MakeMeld funciton ( 1 hour 30 minutes )

-   Made the Hand's constructor when the actual card and meld are passed ( 1 hour )

-   tested the Hand constructor. Debugged the hand constructor where, the melding was not happening properly. And refactored the constructor to construct melds first and then actual hand ( 2 hours )

-   added and tested functions like getHand(), getMeld(), getDividedActualHandCardList() ( 2 hours )

-   created mend to string function and actual hand to string funciotn and tested them ( 45 minutes )

-   Researched about how to deep copy vector and added copy constructor for card Class and tested them so that the getter funciton would return back deep copy data( 45 minutes )

###### Total: 10 hours 30 minutes.
